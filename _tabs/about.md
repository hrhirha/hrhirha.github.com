My name is **Hamza Rhirha**. I am pationate about cybersecurity, precisely the offensive side.

I use online platforms like **HackTheBox** and **TryHackMe** to improve my skills and develop new ones.


Lately I have obtained a [certificate]({{page.CERT}}) after completing [**Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course**]({{page.TCM-PEH}}) by TCM Security.
